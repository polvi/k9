# monokube

monokube is a single binary that includes everything you need to run kubernetes  including apiserver, controller-manager, scheduler and etcd. It is different than hyperkube because all processes are ran in go-routines in a single binary, making it a complete working environment in one command. 

Additionally, monokube includes functionality that allows you to set up reverse ssh tunnels from your nodes to your locally running cluster (on your laptop), making it painless to setup a properly functioning cluster. This is particularly useful if you want to use kubernetes as an alternative to tools such as puppet or ansible for initial host bootstrapping. 

## Install

monokube is intended to be ran from your laptop or development environment. 

```
curl https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/polvi/monokube/master/bin/darwin/amd64/monokube > monokube
shasum monokube 
 1e9ad46763cd2e2ac169f2295f668f3f47b603  monokube
chmod +x monokube
```

## Basic Master


At this point `monokube` is your complete master control plane and can be started with:

```
./monokube
2016-01-19 14:42:25.225409 I | etcdmain: etcd Version: 2.2.1
2016-01-19 14:42:25.225434 I | etcdmain: Git SHA: Not provided (use ./build instead of go build)
2016-01-19 14:42:25.225439 I | etcdmain: Go Version: go1.5.3
2016-01-19 14:42:25.225444 I | etcdmain: Go OS/Arch: darwin/amd64
I0119 14:42:25.225456   48048 plugins.go:71] No cloud provider specified.
2016-01-19 14:42:25.225453 I | etcdmain: setting maximum number of CPUs to 4, total number of available CPUs is 4
2016-01-19 14:42:25.225470 W | etcdmain: no data-dir provided, using default data-dir ./default.etcd
W0119 14:42:25.225219   48048 controllermanager.go:229] Neither --kubeconfig nor --master was specified.  Using default API client.  This might not work.
I0119 14:42:25.225743   48048 master.go:368] Node port range unspecified. Defaulting to 30000-32767.
I0119 14:42:25.225913   48048 master.go:390] Will report 10.7.3.103 as public IP address.
...
```

Once running, test it out with kubectl (the API server will be at 127.0.0.1:8080):

```
./kubectl version
Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"1", GitVersion:"v1.1.4+$Format:%h$", GitCommit:"$Format:%H$", GitTreeState:"not a git tree"}
Server Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"1", GitVersion:"v1.1.4+$Format:%h$", GitCommit:"$Format:%H$", GitTreeState:"not a git tree"}
```

## Cluster setup

monokube can optionally setup ssh reverse proxy tunnels to nodes running the kubelet, making it painless to setup a secure cluster. Additionally it will invoke the kubelet with the right command line args to connect to the tunnel.

```
./monokube --nodes=host1.mylab:22,host2.mylab:22
```

`kubectl` is included with binary too and can be accessed by creating a symlink to the original binary:

```
ln -s ./monokube ./kubectl 
```


### Example using Vagrant

Grab [coreos-vagrant](https://github.com/coreos/coreos-vagrant) and edit `config.rb` to set `$num_instances=3`, then from the `coreos-vagrant` directory:

```
vagrant up
```

`coreos-vagrant` will bring up the nodes with static IPs, so you can use them to target using the `--nodes` flag on `monokube`. 

```
./monokube --nodes=172.17.8.101:22,172.17.8.102:22,172.17.8.103:22
```

Now check that the nodes came up with `kubectl`

```
./kubectl get nodes
NAME           LABELS                                STATUS    AGE
172.17.8.101   kubernetes.io/hostname=172.17.8.101   Ready     1s
172.17.8.102   kubernetes.io/hostname=172.17.8.102   Ready     1s
172.17.8.103   kubernetes.io/hostname=172.17.8.103   Ready     0s
```
